# Weather Sonification for ARM

Design of a weather sonification product for the 'Design, Construction and Test' spring and summer term module - ElecEng, University of York, Year 2 (2019).

Coded in uVision for the STM32F407VG micro-controller processor unit.

The product we choose as a team was a passive weather sonification device that plays a unique ambient soundscape based on certain weather parameters.
Each element within the soundscape would be paired to different environmental sensors to characterise the current weather into a calming and relaxing auditory piece of music.
